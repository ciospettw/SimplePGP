## üñ•Ô∏è How are keys saved?

Generated keys are encrypted and automatically saved in a secure folder in the user's home directory:
- **Linux/macOS:** `~/.mypgp_vault/`
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\YOURNAME\.mypgp_vault\`

No key is ever saved in plain text!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security
- Keys are always encrypted locally.
- NEVER send your private key over the Internet.
- If you lose your masterkey (created automatically the first time), you will not be able to recover your keys.
